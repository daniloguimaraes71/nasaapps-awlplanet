## Project overview

Simulation game for creating your own universe

### Background

* The universe is a wonderful and attractive creation but difficult to understand.
* Planets are different in size and chemistry.
* Relation between the planets and stars is vast and mysterious.
* Learning about planets in the universe can be challenging.

### What it does

* Share the knowledge
* Fact based game (True science)
* Kids friendly
* For everyone, everywhere

### How it’s done

* A simulation game that explores the creation of a star system
* Players customize the star system and create planets by choosing custom characteristics, number of moons, rings, etc. and maybe harbor life.
* Some available features include size, surface chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, orbit, moons, distance from the sun, and other.
* Asteroids, comets, meteorites and other elements are also part of the game.
* Players can interact and observe in time the dynamic of the star systems including the habitable zone.

### Future Plans

* Expand missions' goals and challenges
* Cloud base multiplayer
* First contact with alien “civilizations”
* “Milky way’s” evolution playback
* Many more science-fun functions

### Built With

* Blender – Used to create a prototype of the simulation engine.
* Html – Used to create a demo version of the prototype.
* Unity – Actual implementation of the game will be conducted in this development tool.
